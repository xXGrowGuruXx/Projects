<h1><strong>Explanation</strong></h1>

This program was developed as part of a project for Valeo IT International GmbH.

Previously, the setup of Windows systems was managed using a combination of Batch and PowerShell scripts. During my school internship at Valeo IT, it quickly became clear that I was well-versed in programming. As a result, I was tasked with consolidating their automation process into a single programming language.

I chose C# to create a fully automated setup process that includes the following features:

- **Windows Updates**: Search for, download, and install updates.
- **Wi-Fi Configuration**: Set up Wi-Fi access.
- **Driver Installation**: Install necessary driver software and drivers.
- **PC Renaming**: Change the computer's name.
- **Standard Programs**: Install commonly used applications like browsers and office programs (specific applications are excluded for confidentiality reasons).
- **TeamViewer**: Install a customized TeamViewer version.
- **User Import**: Import user data (files not included for confidentiality reasons).
- **Default User**: Set a default user.

<h2><em>Note</em></h2>

The program is fully functional, provided the necessary company-specific data is available. However, for confidentiality reasons, these data are not included in this public version.
