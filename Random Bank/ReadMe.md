<h1><strong>Explanation:</strong></h1>

This WindowsForms project was created as a school project.

It lasted for 3 days. We were given a specification document with the task of adhering to it.

We were supposed to work under the following conditions:

- Specification document
  
- Database
  
- No possibility for follow-up discussions with the client

We worked in a team of two. Some parts of the specification could not be implemented due to errors in the database.

In these cases, a MessageBox appears with the text "...Coming Soon...Maybe..."
