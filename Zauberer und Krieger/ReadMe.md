<h1><strong>Explanation:</strong></h1>

This console program was created as a school project.

We were given the task of writing a minimalist program in which we demonstrate our understanding of getters and setters, inheritance, and similar concepts.

I expanded on the idea and turned it into a game.

There are 2 different player types, and the opponent automatically chooses the one that wasn't selected.

<h2>Enjoy the game!</h2> <h3>Warrior:</h3>

- Can attack with 6 damage

- If the opponent is vulnerable, deals 10 damage

- Can also dodge for 2 turns

<h3>Mage:</h3>

- Can attack with 3 damage

- Can brew a potion to deal 12 damage, but becomes vulnerable for 3 turns

<h3>Simple AI Logic:</h3>

- The opponent automatically selects the unchosen class

- The opponent randomly chooses from the available options
